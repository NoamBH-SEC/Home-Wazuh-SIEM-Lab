## 📌 Project Overview

The project focuses on **analyzing attack artifacts in system and network logs** and on **detecting threats using SIEM-class systems**.  
For this purpose, a complete **laboratory environment simulating a SOC** was built, allowing to simulate real cyberattacks, capture their traces, and analyze detection methods.

Main project goals:

- understand how attacks **leave detectable artifacts in logs**
- learn how to **collect and correlate data from multiple sources**
- detect attacks using **Elastic Stack, Zeek, Suricata, Sysmon, Windows Event Log**
- map attacker activity to the **MITRE ATT&CK** model
- design and build a **SOC laboratory environment** enabling **realistic attack simulations**

---

## 🧪 Laboratory Environment

The environment replicates a corporate network and consists of:

- **pfSense** — firewall and SPAN/mirror port  
- **Kali Linux** — attacking machine  
- **Windows Server 2019** — AD domain controller, DNS, IIS  
- **Windows 10** — domain client (victim machine)  
- **Ubuntu (Wazuh)** — HIDS host collecting logs from Wazuh agent  
- **Ubuntu (Elastic Stack)** — main SIEM detection host centralizing logs from multiple sources, containing:
  - **Fleet Server with Elastic Agent**
  - **Filebeat, Winlogbeat**
  - **Kibana and Elasticsearch**
  - integrated **Suricata** and **Zeek** for network traffic analysis

> Entire environment runs on VMware Workstation

## ⚡ Attack Scenario — Implementation and Execution

1. **Network reconnaissance** – subnet and port scanning (Nmap)
2. **Brute-force attack on RDP** – Hydra + SecLists dictionaries
3. **Remote login to the machine** – xfreerdp (RDP)
4. **Download and execute Apollo payload** – generated in Mythic C2
5. **Persistence** – scheduled task (SYSTEM) and registry entry (user)
6. **Post-exploitation reconnaissance and data exfiltration** – Apollo functions (whoami, screenshot, keylogger, download)
7. **Test of persistence mechanisms** – logging in as another user

## 🕵️ Detection and Analysis

The following tools and methods were used to detect and investigate the attack:

- **Network detection** — Suricata alerts, Zeek logs
- **Host detection** — Sysmon and Windows Event Log 
- **Central log analysis** — Elastic Stack dashboards (Kibana)  
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** — tracking file and registry changes  
- **Sandbox and reputation** — analyzing the file in VirusTotal

Identified artifacts included: **attacker IP address, file hash, paths, registry changes, scheduled task, encoded PowerShell commands, process trees, network anomalies**, and **techniques mapped to MITRE ATT&CK**.

---

## 🧠 Analytical Models

Collected artifacts and activities were classified using:

- **Pyramid of Pain** — assessing detection value vs. ease of evasion  
- **MITRE ATT&CK** — mapping each attack stage to known tactics and techniques (visualized in ATT&CK Navigator)

This allowed determining which techniques were effectively detected and where visibility gaps existed.

---

## 📈 Results

- Built a complete SOC lab environment from scratch  
- Executed a full attack chain and collected real detection data  
- Performed a **comprehensive detection analysis**  
- **Reconstructed the exact attack timeline from logs**
- Mapped all stages to **MITRE ATT&CK** and evaluated tool effectiveness  

The repository contains **step-by-step documentation of attack and detection** along with **screenshots from the attack and detection process**.
